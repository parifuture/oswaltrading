          	<p>Yes. All mutual funds have fees and expenses that are paid by investors. These costs, like all investing costs, are important because 
          	  they affect the return on your investment. All funds have ongoing expenses that you will pay as long as you have an investment in the 
          	  fund. Some funds also require that you pay a sales commission when you buy, sell, or exchange the fund. The charges you pay to buy or 
          	  sell shares of a fund, plus the annual costs you pay that are associated with operating the fund, affect how much you receive from your
          	   investment.
          	</p>
          	<p>Because investors have many different needs, there are many different types of mutual funds. And the costs you pay for investing in 
          	  funds take different forms. Understanding these costs, and how they affect your investment, is an essential step in becoming an informed investor.

          	<img src="style/images/art/entry2.jpg" class="left" alt="" />
          	<p>Mutual funds provide a variety of investment-related services and benefits that help make saving and investing simple, accessible, and
          	   affordable. These benefits and services, however, have a cost. The fees you pay help cover the costs of managing the fund’s portfolio of
          	    securities. They also are used to pay for producing account statements, computerized account services, recordkeeping, legal services,
          	     printing, and mailing. Some fees also compensate an investment professional for his or her services, especially for the advice he or 
          	     she provides in helping you select a fund to meet your investment goals.
          	</p>

            <h2>Should I switch out of a mutual fund if the portfolio manager changes?</h2><span class="postdate">24 Oct 2011</span>
          	<img src="style/images/art/entry1.jpg" class="left" alt="" />
          	<p>No. The change of a portfolio manager is not reason, in and of itself, to leave a fund. Instead, monitor the mutual fund closely to make
          	   sure the new manager is continuing the old manager's style, and that any changes won't significantly affect your investment. New 
          	   portfolio managers have been known to take command of a mutual fund and sell off securities, reflecting a change in style. A significant
          	    portfolio realignment might mean greater capital gains distributions, and therefore taxes, unless you hold the mutual fund in a 
          	    tax-sheltered account. On the other hand, if the mutual fund is an index fund or less actively managed, the portfolio manager may not
          	     be all that important. Or the new portfolio manager may continue with the old style and perform just fine.
          	</p>
            <p>Switch to a mutual fund with a similar investment objective only when the performance of your fund falls off against other funds with 
              the same investment objective, or if your existing fund changes objectives so that it no longer reflects the objective you are seeking.

 			<h2>If a mutual fund closes before I have a chance to invest and a clone is available, should I invest in the clone fund?</h2><span class="postdate">24 Oct 2011</span>
             <img src="style/images/art/entry5.jpg" class="left" alt="" />
          
          	<p>Most mutual funds close because the portfolio manager feels a larger fund size will hamper his investment flexibility and style. 
          	  Therefore, it is unlikely that any "clone" fund will in fact be a perfect clone of the original—what would be the point of closing the
          	  first one? Clone funds—the Roman numeral II funds—often do not have the same portfolio manager or precisely the same investment strategy

          <p>All mutual funds have a certain amount of risk involved in investing in them. But that is no reason to not invest. Risk has to be taken in any
             situation to get good returns. However there are a number of investment strategies that one can employ to insulate oneself against the risks 
             involved in the markets.
          </p>
          <p>There are certain safe investments like blue chip investments and gold investments that have low risk levels. Diversification is another way to make
             sure that your portfolio is protected. Invest in some amount of risk but make sure that there are safe investments so that the portfolio is 
             protected against market fluctuations.
          </p>
          <p>You should always make sure to conduct proper research into the fund and the fund company that you wish to invest in. Make sure that the company has a
             good reputation in the market and that the fund has been performing well in the past. Reliance Mutual Funds is one of the best AMC's currently in the
             country which offers good investment options.

          <h2>What are the benefits of investing in a Mutual Fund?</h2><span class="postdate">24 Oct 2011</span>
          <img src="style/images/art/entry7.jpg" class="left" alt="" />
          
          <p>There are several benefits from investing in a Mutual Fund. <br />
            <b>Small investments :</b> Mutual funds help you to reap the benefit of returns by a portfolio spread across a wide spectrum of 
              companies with small investments. Such a spread would not have been possible without their assistance.
          </p>
          <p><b>Professional Fund Management :</b> 
            Professionals having considerable expertise, experience and resources manage the pool of money collected by a mutual fund. They thoroughly
            analyse the markets and economy to pick good investment opportunities.
          </p>
          <p><b>Spreading Risk :</b> An investor with a limited amount of fund might be able to to invest in only one or two stocks / bonds, thus increasing his
               or her risk. However, a mutual fund will spread its risk by investing a number of sound stocks or bonds. A fund normally invests in companies across
               a wide range of industries, so the risk is diversified at the same time taking advantage of the position it holds. Also in cases of  liquidity 
               crisis where stocks are sold at a distress, mutual funds  have the advantage of the redemption option at the NAVs.
          </p>
          <p><b>Transparency and interactivity :</b> 
            Mutual Funds regularly provide investors with information on the value of their investments. Mutual Funds also provide complete 
            portfolio disclosure of the investments made by various schemes and also the proportion invested in each asset type. Mutual Funds 
            clearly layout their investment strategy to the investor.
          </p>
          <p><b>Liquidity :</b> Closed ended 
            funds have their units listed at the stock exchange, thus they can be bought and sold at their market value. Over and above this the 
            units can be directly redeemed to the Mutual Fund as and when they announce the repurchase.
          </p>
          <p><b>Choice :</b> The large amount of 
            Mutual Funds offer the investor a wide variety to choose from. An investor can pick up a scheme depending upon his risk / return 
            profile.
          </p>
          <p><b>Regulations :</b> All the mutual 
            funds are registered with SEBI and they function within the provisions of strict regulation designed to protect the interests of 
            the investor.

          <p>A portfolio of a mutual fund scheme is the basket of financial assets held by that scheme. It comprises of investments in a variety of securities 
            and asset classes. This diversification helps reduces the overall risk. A mutual fund scheme states the kind of portfolio it seeks to construct as 
            well as the risks involved under each asset class.

          <p>The charge collected by a Mutual Fund from an investor for selling the units or investing in it. When a charge is collected at the time of
             entering into the scheme it is called an Entry load or Front-end load or Sales load. The entry load percentage is added to the NAV at the
             time of allotment of units.
          </p> 
          <p>An Exit load or Back-end load or Repurchase load is a charge that is collected at the time of redeeming or for
             transfer between schemes (switch). The exit load percentage is deducted from the NAV at the time of redemption or transfer between schemes.
             Some schemes do not charge any load and are called "No Load Schemes"

          <p>Some mutual funds are more risky than others. There really is no guarantee that your investment will give you a positive return after 5 years. Over 
            a 5 year period though with a SIP plan, there is about a 90% probability that you should get a good return. Your probability of a positive return 
            increases with the less risky funds but the probability of a greater return increases with the more risky fund. You would really have to decide 
            yourself on which fund or funds to invest in.

          <p><strong>Equity Funds</strong> are exposed to market risk i.e. there is a possibility that the price of the stocks in which the Fund has
             invested could decrease. Of course, the prices may also increase, making it possible for the fund to earn profits.</p> 
          <p>Debts Funds are exposed to two main risks:</p>
          <p><strong>Credit Risk</strong> 
              <p>The company in whose bonds the fund has invested could default on the payment of its interest or principal.</p> 
          <p><strong>Interest Rate Risk</strong> 
              The price of the bond in which the Fund has invested may decrease because of an increase in the interest rates. In general, it is
                 useful to remember that this is a "see-saw" relationship - bond prices (and therefore, NAVs) increase when interest rates decrease and
                  vice versa.
